      <h2>Johannesburg</h2>

      <p>
        Johannesburg, often called "Joburg" or "Jozi," is the largest city in
        South Africa and a key economic hub in Africa. It was founded in 1886
        following the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand, sparking a gold
        rush that transformed it from a small settlement into a booming city.
        The city was initially a mining town, attracting fortune seekers from
        around the world. Over time, Johannesburg became a center for commerce
        and industry, eventually outgrowing its mining roots. It played a
        significant role in the struggle against apartheid, with important
        historical events like the Soweto Uprising of 1976 happening nearby.
        Today, Johannesburg is a modern metropolis known for its vibrant
        culture, diverse population, and economic significance. It is home to
        the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), major businesses, and cultural
        landmarks like the Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill. Despite its
        wealth, the city faces challenges such as inequality, housing shortages,
        and crime, but it remains a symbol of resilience and opportunity in
        South Africa.
